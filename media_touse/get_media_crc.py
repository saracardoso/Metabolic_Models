    # Convertion of media concentrations to fluxes is performed using the following equation:
    # flux = ([metabolite]]) / ([cell] * cell_weight * time)
    #
    # [metabolite] --> concentration of the metabolite in the medium, in mM
    # [cell]       --> concentration of cells, in nÂºcells/L
    # cell_weight  --> dry weight of a cell, in gDW
    # time         --> time that the cell takes to consume the metabolite
    #
    # Values calculated elsewhere

    # The average dry weight of a CRC cell is:
    CRC_weight = 3.96632116942834*10e-11  # gDW

    # Considering the optimal CRC concentration in a medium to be 1*10e7 cells/L
    CRC_concentration = 1.35*10e7  # cells/L

    # Considering that culture media is normally changed every two days:
    CRC_time = 48  # h

    # The following metabolites will be set to unconstrained, i.e, always available:
    unconstrain = ['HMR_9047',  # H2O

                   'HMR_9079'  # H+
                   ]

    # Media concentration values will be converted to fluxes using these values and saved to a file:
    # Plus, columns will be added to account for all the media metabolites to be unconstrained.
