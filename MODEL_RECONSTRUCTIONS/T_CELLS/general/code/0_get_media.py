    # Convertion of media concentrations to fluxes is performed using the following equation:
    # flux = ([metabolite]]) / ([cell] * cell_weight * time)
    #
    # [metabolite] --> concentration of the metabolite in the medium, in mM
    # [cell]       --> concentration of cells, in nÂºcells/L
    # cell_weight  --> dry weight of a cell, in gDW
    # time         --> time that the cell takes to consume the metabolite

    # Knowing that osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells have a cell dry weight of ~60 pg and a cell volume of 4000 um3
    # And that the volume of a T lymphocyte is ~176 um3
    # The T lymphocyte dry weight can be calculated as follows:
    volume_ratio = 4000 / 176  # which makes 22.73 ratio
    Tcell_weight = 60 / volume_ratio * 1e-12  # which makes ~2.640*10e-12 gDW

    # Considering the optimal Tcell concentration in a medium to be 2.5*10e5 cells/mL
    Tcell_concentration = 2.5*10e8  # cells/L

    # Considering that culture media is normally changed every two days:
    Tcell_time = 48  # h

    # The following metabolites will be set to unconstrained, i.e, always available:
    unconstrain = ['HMR_9047',  # H2O
                   'HMR_9048',  # O2
                   'HMR_9079'  # H+
                   ]

    # Media concentration values will be converted to fluxes using these values and saved to a file:
    # Plus, columns will be added to account for all the media metabolites to be unconstrained.
