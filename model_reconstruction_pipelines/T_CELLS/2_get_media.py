# Convertion of media concentrations to fluxes is performed using the following equation:
# flux = ([metabolite]]) / ([cell] * cell_weight * time)
#
# [metabolite] --> concentration of the metabolite in the medium, in mM
# [cell]       --> concentration of cells, in nÂºcells/L
# cell_weight  --> dry weight of a cell, in gDW
# time         --> time that the cell takes to consume the metabolite

# Knowing that osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells have a cell dry weight of ~60 pg and a cell volume of 4000 um3
# And that the volume of a T lymphocyte is ~176 um3
# The T lymphocyte dry weight can be calculated as follows:
volume_ratio = 4000 / 176  # which makes 22.73 ratio
Tcell_weight = 60 / volume_ratio * 1e-12  # which makes ~2.640*10e-12 gDW

# Considering the optimal Tcell concentration in a medium to be 2.5*10e5 cells/mL
Tcell_concentration = 2.5*10e8  # cells/L

# Considering that culture media is normally changed every two days:
Tcell_time = 48  # h

# The following metabolites will be set to unconstrained, i.e, always available:
unconstrain = ['HMR_9047',  # H2O
               'HMR_9048',  # O2
               'HMR_9079',  # H+
               'HMR_9383',  # O2S
               'HMR_9058',  # CO2
               'HMR_9354',  # H2O2
               'EX_h2co3[e]',  # H2CO3
               'HMR_9288',  # CO
               ]

# Media concentration values will be converted to fluxes using these values and saved to a file:
# Plus, columns will be added to account for all the media metabolites to be unconstrained.
